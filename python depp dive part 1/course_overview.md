# This course is about
- the python language and built-in types.
- the standard library.
- becoming an expert python developer.
- idiomatic python.

# Zen of Python
- Beautifull is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better nested.
- Sparse is better dense.
- Readabiity counts.
- Special cases are not special enough to break he rules.
- Altough practicality beats purify.
- Errors should never pass silenty.
- Unless explicity silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one -- and preferably nly one --obvius wai to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvius at first unless you are Dutch.
- Now is better thn never.
- Although never is often better than rigth now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good ideia.
- Namespaces are one hoking great idea - let's do more of those!

# Quick Refresher
- Python's type hierarchy
- variables
- conditionals
- functions
- loops
- break, continue and try
- classes

# Variables and Memory
- WHat are variables?
- Memory?
- Python memory management?
- Mutability?
- Whatis equality of two objects?
- Python memory optimizations?

# Numeric Types
- integers
- rationals
- floats
- Decimals
- Complex numbers

# Booleans
- Associated truth values
- precedence and short-circuiting
- boolean operators
- coomparison operators

# Functions
- higher-order functions
- doctrings and annotations
- lambdas
- introspection
- functional programming

# Arguments of Functions
- positional arguents
- keywords-onl arguments
- default values
- packing and upacking
- variable positional arguments
- variable keyword-only arguments

# Scope and closures of function
- global and local scopes
- nested scopes
- closures
- nested closures

# Decorators
- decorators
- nested decorators
- parameterized decorators
- stacked decorators

- decorator classes
- applications

# Tules as data structures
- tuples are not just read-only lists
- data structures
- packing and unpacking
- named tuples
- augmenting named tuples
