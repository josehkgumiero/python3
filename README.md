###### Introduction

- The Python language.
- The Built types.
- The Standard library.
- Becoming expert Python Developer.

###### Zen of Python
- Beautifull is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better nested.
- Sparse is better dense.
- Readabiity counts.
- Special cases are not special enough to break he rules.
- Altough practicality beats purify.
- Errors should never pass silenty.
- Unless explicity silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one -- and preferably nly one --obvius wai to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvius at first unless you are Dutch.
- Now is better thn never.
- Although never is often better than rigth now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it is a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good ideia.
- Namespaces are one hoking great idea - let's do more of those!
